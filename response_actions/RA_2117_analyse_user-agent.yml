  A User-Agent string is a piece of metadata that is sent across in the header of a HTTP request and is typically used for content negotiation as outlined within [RFC1945|https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945#page-46].  To analyse a user-agent you may perform:

  # Retrieve the user-agent from the HTTP header.
  # Using the below methodology as a reference make a judgement as to whether the user-agent provided is suspicious or not.  
    Indications of suspicious user-agents based upon string analysis:
  #* The user-agent is left empty.
  #* The user-agent contains typos or deviations in capitilisation that are different from known good user-agents. 
  #* The user-agent contains a sequence of random characters or "gibberish" akin to those found within MITRE ATT&CK [T1568.002|https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1568/002/
  #* The user-agent contains code that would execute an XSS or SQL Injection attack. 

    Indications of suspicious user-agents based upon reputational analysis:
  #* The user-agent is not listed as a popular user-agent on reference materials such as [WhatIsMyBrowser|https://developers.whatismybrowser.com/useragents/explore/].
  #* It should be noted that there is value in engaging with the community on particular User-Agents, and this can often be done by leveraging a search engine such as Google. 

  # Contextualise your findings with knowledge from your environment. 
  #* Consider whether the user-agent is relevant for your SoE environment.  For instance, the presence of Mac OS X user-agents in a Windows only environment.
  #* Consider performing long-tail analysis or clustering to identify anomalies within your environment. 

  h3. Important Notes:
  * User-Agents are client-side generated and can be easily spoofed.  Many adversaries will default to leveraging known-good user-agents to hide activity.
  * Many benign applications (particularly custom applications) will omit user-agent strings, and as such false positives may be plentiful.  It may be worth tying this analysis in with other analysis to increase the signal fidelity.
